Arnie,

You can look at my history. 

It's not amazing, and I'm not proud I'm not better at Git, but I can do basic shit, the tools are hyper annoying and it's a pita and doesn't make a lot of sense when you're working by yourself, so I tried to learn it better and couldn't really justify the effort.

like, I love myself and my time and my sanity too much for it to be worthwhile for me to wrap my head around how git works

if we could use git to write a book, then it would be easy enough

maybe i should put my thoughts here to edit over time, but with a full commit history...

eeesh, now that's scary!

oh, but wait, i had already started this project like lilia back when i sent that one email. trusting that i wasnt a crazy person even when i most seemed like a crazy person, even to my own best friends. but i just trusted that i am lilia on some level: the queen of cups. and that i am. but also the magician.
