Arnie,

You can look at my history. 

It's not amazing, and I'm not proud I'm not better at Git, but I can do basic shit, the tools are hyper annoying and it's a pita and doesn't make a lot of sense when you're working by yourself, so I tried to learn it better and couldn't really justify the effort.
